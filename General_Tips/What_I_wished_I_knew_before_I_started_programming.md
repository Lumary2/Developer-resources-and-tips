## Programming is a lot of work
Yes, programming is fun, but to get there you have to go a long way. Some programming languages are very easy to learn, some require significantly more effort. If you want to become good at programming, that means programming and learning a lot.

## Documentation
Someone who is lazy about writing shouldn't program. Because programming requires a high level of documentation. Especially at work and when several employees are working on a project, everything must be precisely documented. That's why good comments are very important.

It also happens with time that every programmer creates his own personal cheat sheet and notes. Some do it offline with a notebook and pen. Others use special editors, ideally with native Markdown support, to record useful knowledge

## A lifelong learning
Programming means learning for a lifetime. Be open to new technologies. You should also follow the development of the programming languages that you master.

## Deadline
If you are working on your own project you can set the deadlines as you like. If you can't finish, you can move it further back.

Deadlines are very important in the company. If these cannot be adhered to, this must be communicated clearly as early as possible. Therefore, an extensive assessment of the effort is not only sensible in advance, but also essential.
