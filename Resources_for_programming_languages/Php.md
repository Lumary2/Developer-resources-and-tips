## PHP resources

#### Basic syntax and built-in functions
1. **w3schools.com** <https://www.w3schools.com/php/default.asp>
beginner frendly with easy explanation.
2. **PHP official docs** <https://www.php.net/docs.php>
The official documentation and vast resource. Recommend it when you are fairly experienced.

#### PHP framework basics for beginners
Once you know the basic syntax it is recommended to use a PHP framework as using plain PHP is not suitable to build apps and websites. See <https://symfony.com/why-use-a-framework>  
I recommend using Symfony Components <https://symfony.com/components> by Symfony Project <https://symfony.com/components>.  
As one can combine plain PHP and prebuilt Symfony Components.  
They have a easy to follow guide which teaches web framework basics and how to create a framework <https://symfony.com/doc/current/create_framework/index.html>.
